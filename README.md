# StopitGame
This is a very simple game using nodeJS, Ethereum Web3 and P5js
you can play the game as different accounts. I used ganache to test it locally and deploy the contract, then the app how the 10 test accounts in the local ganache vm. you can switch back and forth.

how to play:

- you get more points when you stop the growing circle inside de blue circle, if you get it there you get a 10k bonus points, if you are in the white circle you can get 1000 less the distance in pixels from the blue circle. if you stop in the yellow are game is over.

- use up_arrow to make the red circle to grow
- use the down_arrow key to make the red circle to get smaller
- use the space key to stop the red circle growing

- each time you stop next lap is going faster until game is over.

the points are stored in the ethereum contract in the block chain for each account.

- have to install, P5JS, express, web3 and nodejs

that is it! STOPIT!
